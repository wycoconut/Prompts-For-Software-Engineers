# Job Scope Of a Forward Deployed Engineer (By OpenAI)
_Taken From OpenAI Careers_

## About the role

Forward Deployed Engineers lead complex deployments of frontier models in production. You will embed with customers where model performance matters, delivery is urgent, and ambiguity is the default. You will use this to map their problems, structure delivery, and ship fast. You will scope, sequence, and build full-stack solutions that create measurable value. You will also drive clarity across internal and external teams. You will identify reusable patterns and share field signal that influences the roadmap.

Success in this role means owning the delivery state across workstreams. You will hold the bar on quality and pace and help OpenAI learn through execution.

This role is based in Tokyo. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

To succeed in this position you must be fully bilingualâ€”fluent in both Japanese and English (spoken and written). Please note that your resume must be submitted in English, and the interview process will include conversations in both languages.

## In this role you will

- Own technical delivery across multiple deployments from first prototype to stable production

- Build full-stack systems that deliver customer value and sharpen how we learn

- Embed closely with customer teams, understand their needs, and guide adoption of what you build

- Scope work, sequence delivery, and remove blockers early

- Make trade-offs between scope, speed, and quality; adjust plans to protect delivery

- Contribute directly in the code when progress or clarity depends on it

- Codify working patterns into tools, playbooks, or building blocks that others can use

- Share field feedback that helps Research and Product understand where the models succeed and where they can improve

- Keep teams moving through clarity and follow-through

## You might thrive in this role if you

- Bring 5+ years of engineering or technical deployment experience that includes customer-facing work

- Have scoped and delivered complex systems in fast-moving or ambiguous environments

- Write and review production-grade code across frontend and backend using Python, JavaScript, or comparable stacks

- Have built or deployed systems powered by LLMs or generative models and understand how model behaviour affects product experience

- Simplify complexity and make fast, sound decisions under pressure

- Communicate clearly with engineers, product teams, and customer stakeholders

- Spot risks early and adjust without slowing down

- Model calm and judgment when the stakes are high
