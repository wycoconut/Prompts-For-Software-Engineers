# Github Readme Templates

Readme Studio<BR>
[WebApp](https://readmestudio.zenui.net/) | [Github](https://github.com/zenui-labs/readme-studio)

- Look in the top menu "Templates", has a nice list of templates that you can take and modify.
- Although it says "Generate Readme", it doesn't work.
- Go to the Github Repo, this app is open source, you need to plug-in your own API (update .env file)

## DocsHound

Tool : https://docshound.com/<BR>
Chrome Extension : https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/docshound/mpljambmafeklhfjlmnbheimdigkdbcg<BR>

Their motto : Transform everyday explanations into livingÂ knowledge assets.

Review Notes :
- Grant permission to your browser if you are recording your voice over.
- It takes a few minutes to finish processing.  Be patient.
- If it doesn't refresh itself, you have to login to the dashboard and check the output
- You can use AI to refine certain parts of your documentation.
- The Doc is nice as it has jump links to specific sections of your video.
- Can export document as text or markdown.
- It functions like a mini RAG, because you can turn on a chatbot and allow people to ask question on your content.  You will need to publish your content first.
	- Tip : If you have a security issue when browsing your published content, use Safari Browser and bypass the security check.
- Give the Chatbot a test, it will show you exactly which screenshot to refer to.

# Record Demo and Create Video Documentation

Tool : https://www.guidde.com/<BR>

Review Notes :
- You will see a "g." icon on your screen, click on that and click on "start".
- You don't need to record any voice over.  The AI will generate it for you.

	- Translation of the script is a Paid Feature.
- You can put your profile image in your video.
