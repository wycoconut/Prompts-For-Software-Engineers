Sample Prompt to create a basic PRD.

```
Help me create a Product Requirements Document. Here's what we're building:

An [name of framework / general language]-powered [type of app]. [insert styling or design here].

The tech stack I know | will use is: [frontend language / framework], [backend language],
[(optional) mechanism] for deployment, and [database language / engine] for the backend.

These are the features I want to include: 
* [description of feature 1]
* [description of feature 2]
* [description of feature 3]

I will be building this with an Al co-pilot, so I don't need any team milestones or anything like that.

Ask me if you have any questions for clarification, and continue to write the PRD.
```
